This mobile application leverages cutting-edge computer vision and AI algorithms to accurately count the number of hairs on a user’s head. By simply taking a photo of the scalp, the app processes the image to detect individual hair strands and offers detailed statistics about hair density and distribution. The data empowers users to easily monitor changes over time—helpful for evaluating hair growth treatments, diagnosing hair loss patterns, or simply staying informed about hair health. The user-friendly interface and real-time results make the application an accessible solution for both personal care and professional consultations.
